## Autonomous drone landing on target

**Work-log for Bachelor's Thesis at BUT FIT**

This thesis focuses on implementing computer vision methods and integrating them into autonomous drone systems.

---

**Preparation**

- **Research & Understanding**
  - [x] Search for relevant projects and case studies.
  - [ ] Read literature on computer vision and autonomous drone landing techniques.
  - [ ] Explore core concepts in drone programming and ROS 2 operations.
  
**Environment Setup**

- **Environment Configuration**
  - [x] Set up OpenCV for image processing.
  - [x] Install and configure Gazebo, PX4, and ROS 2.
  - [x] Control a virtual drone with Python.
  - [ ] Run a basic demo project to verify all components are correctly installed and communicating.

**Project Implementation**

- **System Design**
  - [ ] Propose the main software modules

- **Core Development**
  - [ ] Display live drone camera feed in Python.
  - [ ] Implement ArUco marker recognition in OpenCV.
  - [ ] Extract position difference of camera and marker.
  - [ ] Develop a control system to guide the drone toward the detected marker.

- **Simulation Testing**
  - [ ] Test the marker detection and navigation in Gazebo.
  - [ ] Adjust algorithms for accuracy, stability, and response time in a simulated environment.

**Drone Testing**

- **Preparation for Field Testing**
  - [x] Familiarize with legal requirements for drone operation.
  - [ ] Conduct initial tests with a simplified landing program on a physical drone to confirm setup.
  - [ ] Run the complete software solution on the drone, monitoring performance and troubleshooting.
